will tested. BUT, there is nothing to worry about, level 1 is the easiet of the 3 levels in Plage Age 8. You will be asked 20 
geography answers that have individual countries as the answer. For every question you get correct, that country is added to your

you cannot invade any countries. But later, things are going to be fun. 

As each question is displayed on the screen, all you need to do is click on the buttons corresponding to the country that you

Good luck! Try to gain the right to invade as many countries as you can so that you can show the most countries that you can. It's 
important to show tons of people about your immense power
